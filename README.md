# SourceCodeManagement

Source code management is the practice of tracking modifications to source code. Keeping a running history of the changes made to a codebase helps programmers, developers and testers ensure
that they’re always working with accurate and up-to-date code and helps resolve conflicts when merging code from multiple sources.

Source code management solves these problems by:
•	Tracking each developer’s changes.
•	Highlighting conflicts.
•	Preventing code overwriting. 


How source code management works:
The heart of the source code management process is the code repository, a centralized server that stores all of an organization’s code as well as the source code management system that tracks code changes for various 
development projects.
There is a term in source code management i.e. version control. 
Copies of source code are stored as individual files. Developers “check out” a file when they want to make code revisions and receive a copy of that file in their local environment.After the developer makes and tests their 
changes, they “commit” them, saving the revised code to the repository. This replaces the original file, increments the code version number — a process called “version control”.
